# Conclusion

In this lab, we have used the Operator Hub to install OpenShift Serverless. We also used Node.js as our serverless application in OpenShift. We used Docker to build the image and push it to Docker Hub. We also explored on how to configure deployment files to use our container images in Docker Hub and configuring it so that it talks to other components in the cluster. Deploying the serverless app in this lab, we now have completed all the microservices in the Example Bank app.
