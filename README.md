# Advocacy Workshop

This is a template for workshops hosted on Gitbook. To view it online, go to:

<https://ibm-developer.gitbook.io/workshop-template/>

Create a new repo based off this template, and use the following folders as a guide:

```ini

- data (any data (CSV, JSON, etc files) to be used)
- notebooks (any Jupyter notebooks can go here)
- src (any application source code can go here)
- workshop (this is where the workshop is documented)
|_ .gitbook (images should go here)
|_ <folder-n> (these are exercises for the workshop)
  |_README.md (the steps for the exercise, in Markdown)
|_ README.md (this will appear on the gitbook home page)
|_ SUMMARY.md (this dictates the Table of Contents)
.gitbook.yaml (tells GitBook to only read the stuff in 'workshop')
.travis.yaml (runs markdownlint by default)
README.md (only used for GitHub.com)
```

## Tips and conventions

### Screenshots

Screenshots look better if they are full page.
Use [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) to create a nice border around images with this command:

```bash
magick mogrify -bordercolor gray -border 2
```

### Design in GitBook

To ensure a common design for IBM workshops please use following options:

* Select in `Theme & Colors` the theme: `Bold` and the color: `#1C6DBC`

* Select in `Logo & Title` the IBM logo

### Understand the major GitBook template structure

It is useful to understand the used GitBook structure of this [template](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github/content-configuration#structure).

* [README.md](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github/content-configuration#structure): Each README.md dictates the Table of Contents on the right hand side.
* [SUMMARY.md](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github/content-configuration#summary): This dictates the Table of Contents on the left hand side.
  * [root](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github/content-configuration#root): Path to lookup for your documentation defaults to the root directory of the repository.
* [.gitbook.yaml](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github/content-configuration): You can configure how GitBook should parse your Git repository using the `.gitbook.yaml` file that must rely on the root of your repository.

The image shows the file names and their responsibilities.
